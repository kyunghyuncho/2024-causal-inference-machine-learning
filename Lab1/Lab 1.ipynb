Structural causal model\n","2. Covariate, action, and treatment\n","3. Estimation of conditional probability\n","\n","It's a good idea to become familiar with this example, as we'll build upon it in future labs.\n","\n","### **Example (Drug Efficacy)**\n","\n","We're conducting a study to determine whether a new drug is effective at treating an illness. Doctors prescribe a drug to patients, and record three variables:\n","1. $X \\in \\{0, 1\\}$: whether the patient is elderly\n","2. $A \\in \\{0, 1\\}$: whether the patient took the drug\n","3. $Y \\in \\{0, 1\\}$: whether the patient recovered\n","\n","$X$ is the *covariate*, $A$ is the *action*, and $Y$ is the *outcome*. Although we're mainly interested in the relationship between drug-taking (action) and recovery (outcome), we record the age (covariate) as well, since it might be relevant.\n","\n","We can express these beliefs using a *structural causal model (SCM)*. An SCM consists of a set of variables, and a set of functions that assigns each variable a value based on the values of the other variables.\n","\n","Let's start by specifying the relationship between the variables: (i) a patient's age doesn't depend on anything, (ii) drug-taking depends on age, and (iii) recovery depends on both drug-taking and age. This exact information can be represented in a graph, as seen below."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":138},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":1068,"status":"ok","timestamp":1707145598489,"user":{"displayName":"Taro
